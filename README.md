### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am currently a graduate student at Columbia University in the Electrical Engineering Department. Here, I am working with Prof. Shih-Fu Chang, Dr. Long Chen (Post-Doc) and Xudong Lin (PhD), in the DVMM lab as a graduate research assistant.

Before Columbia, I was part of the GREYC Lab (UNICAEN-CNRS-ENSICAEN) and was a research fellow at the Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad.

- I am currently a full-time employee as a ML Engineer on speech recognition and voice activity detection at Silicon Labs in Austin in the Central R&D team. I am looking for new opportunities and would love to connect.
