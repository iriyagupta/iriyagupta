### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am currently a graduate student at Columbia University in the Electrical Engineering Department. Here, I am working with Prof. Shih-Fu Chang & Dr. Long Chen (Post-Doc), in the DVMM lab as a graduate research assistant.

Before Columbia, I have been part of GREYC Lab (UNICAEN-CNRS-ENSICAEN) and was a research fellow at Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad.
